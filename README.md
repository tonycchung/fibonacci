# Fibonacci

## Assignment description

Create a method that accepts input n, and returns the nth fibonacci number.
  
As a developer
I want to know the value of a number at an arbitrary position in the Fibonacci sequence
so that I can show off my coding skills.
  
Went through RED/GREEN/REFACTOR to create a recursive method to fetch the nth fibonacci number with input 'n'.
